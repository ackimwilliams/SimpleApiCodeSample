Problem: Designing an API client to consume an API. The API is described in ./problem_description

I made a few assumptions while working on this problem and left notes of them 
in the class  descriptions at the top of the various files. 

There were locations where error correction or reporting is needed; I deliberately
left those areas blank but noted that error correction might be necessary by 
another third party system if available.

To execute the program run the following command:
php BeginExecution.php inputfile apiversion

Note: register_argc_argv has to be enabled
